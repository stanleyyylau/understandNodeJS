# libuv, The Event Loop, and Non-Blocking Asynchronous Execution

## Big Word

**Asynchronous: More than one process running simultaneously**

Node does things asynchronously. V8 does not.

**Synchronous: One process executing at a time**

Javascript is synchronous. Think of it as only one line of code executing at a time.

NodeJS is asynchronous.

**Non-Blocking: Doing other things without stopping your programming from running.**

This is made possible by Node's doing things asynchronously.
