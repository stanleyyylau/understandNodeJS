# Conceptual Aside: Modules

## Big Word
*Module: A reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code*

javascript didn't have this before(EMCA6 has, but Node was that long ago before ECMA6 was out)

*CommonJS modules: An agreed upon standard for how code modules should be structured*
