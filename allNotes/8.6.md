# init, nodemon, and package.json - Part 2

+ package.JSON is not used by node itself, rather it's by npm

## Development dependencies

``npm install jasmine-node --save-dev``

## You will use this at all your projects
``npm install -g nodemon`` download nodemon globally to your computer so you get access from anywhere in your app

+ Note: notemon itself has its own node_modules folder, it need other dependency to run too.

+ run ``npm update`` will update your dependencies

### What about nodemon
+ after you install nodemon globally, you can access it anywhere from the command line
+ ``run nodemon app.js``
+ if you see a module with ``cli`` folder in it, it's maybe because it's utility is accessed via command line
