# Conceptual Aside: Processors, Machine language, and C++

You have to understand this to have a proper *mental model* of NodeJS

[The Mental Model](../imgs/theMentalModel.png)


## Big Word
Machine Code : programming languages spoken by computer processors

Every program you run on your computer has been converted (compiled) into machine code.

+ Microprocessor is what sit in your computer
+ They don't speak the same language
+ You give sets of instructions to them(machine code)

They speak
+ IA-32
+ x86-64
+ ARM
+ MIPS

## Why we don't write machine code?

## Level of abstraction

Between your javascript code and machine code, there's a engine sitting in the middle


## Node is written in C++

Because V8 is written in C++, They embed V8 to a C++ written program called node, that's how they add more functionalities to node which are originally available in C++
