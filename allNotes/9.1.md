# Installing Express and Making it Easier to Build a Web Server

## Why use express
+ You have access to express request and response object, http methods
+ No need to set *send body* and *send content type* express will figure this out for you.

## Big Word

**Environment Variables: Global variables specific to the environment (server) our code is living in.**

Different servers can have different variable settings, and we can access those values in code.

+ ``var port = process.env.PORT || 3000;``

**HTTP Method: specifies the type of action the request wishes to make**

GET, POST, DELETE, and others. Also called *verbs.*

## The Code

```
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

var port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

//this is get method

//this is what gets return if the client request for / directory
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
	res.send('<html><head></head><body><h1>Hello world!</h1></body></html>');
});

//what gets return when client request for /api directory
app.get('/api', function(req, res) {
	res.json({ firstname: 'John', lastname: 'Doe' });
});

app.listen(port);

```
