# init, nodemon, and package.json

+ Run ``npm init``  on the folder of ur app so other developer can know what dependency you use
+ Fill in information. You will get a package.json
+ ``npm test``  You will run whatever inside the script
+ ``npm install moment --save`` So you can save it to the JSON
+ You will also have a new module, that's what npm is doing for us
