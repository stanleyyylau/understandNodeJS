# Conceptual Aside: Packages and Package Managers

## Big Word

**Package: Code...**

...managed and maintained with a package management system.

**Package management system: Software that automates installing and updating packages.**

Deals with what version you have or need, and manages dependencies.

**Dependency: Code that another set of code depends on to function**

If you use that code in your app, it is a dependency. Your app depends on it.
