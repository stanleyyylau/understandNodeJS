# Conceptual Aside: Binary Data, Character Sets, and Encodings

## Big Word

**Binary Data: Data stored in binary (sets of 1s AND 0s).**

The core of the math that computers are based on.

Each one or zero is called a 'bit' or 'binary digit'.

**Character Set: A representation of characters as numbers**

Each character gets a number. Unicode and ASCII are character sets.

**Character Encoding: How characters are stored in binary**

The numbers (or **code pints**) are converted and stored in binary.
