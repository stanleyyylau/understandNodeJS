# Conceptual Aside: APIs and Endpoints

## Big Word

**API: A set of tools for building a software application.**

Stands for 'Application Programming Interface'. On the web the tools are usually made available via a set of URLs which accept and send only data via HTTP and TCP/IP.

**Endpoint: One URL in a web API.**

Sometimes that endpoint(URL) does multiple thing by making choices based on the HTTP request headers.
