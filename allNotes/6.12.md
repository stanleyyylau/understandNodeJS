# Pipes

## Big Word

**Pipe: Connecting two streams by writing to one stream what is being read from another.**

In Node you pipe from a Readable stream to a Writable stream

**Method Chaining: A method returns an object so we can keep calling more methods.**

Sometimes it returns the parent object(called 'cascading') and sometimes some other object.
